Credit risk is associated with the possibility of a client failing to meet contractual obligations, such as mortgages, credit card debts, and other types of loans.
Minimizing the risk of default is a major concern for financial institutions. For this reason, commercial and investment banks, venture capital funds, asset management companies, and insurance firms, to name a few, are increasingly relying on technology to predict which clients are more prone to stop honoring their debts.

The dataset contains 10,000 values of customers.

**Note 1:**
* Our goal is to obtain a clean & preprocessed dataset
* We'll note down the changes we're making to the original dataset
* This information will be invaluable to the data scientists

**Note 2:**
1. Every categorical variable must be quantified.
2. We need to change any text columns into numbers (Based on info).
3. For others, we only care if they provide +ve or -ve connotations.

**Note 3: Measuring Creditworthiness**
* We need to be extremely risk-averse & distrustful.
* Missing information suggests foul play.
* If information isn't available, assume the worst.
